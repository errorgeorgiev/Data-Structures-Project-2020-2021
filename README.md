Second Year Computer Science: Data Structures Project

CITY MAP PROJECT:
-Reading the information from a text file

OBLIGATORY TASKS:

1.Check if path exists between two junctions

2.Find 3 shortest paths from one junction to other

3.Find 3 shortest paths but with closed junctions

4.Find a cycle from certain junction

5.Find a tour(Euler cycle)

6.Check if we can reach every other junction

7.Find all dead end streets

change @ — changes our location

neighbours — returns all neighbour junctions

move @ — changes our location and prints the path to the new location
